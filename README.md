Hi!
I am a student at Western Governor's University pursuing a Bachelors in Software Development
I am currently supplementing my education with projects such as a library database, and some small games!
I am learning Java, Python, HTML and CSS, and MySQL.
Certified in CompTIA Network+ and Project+.
I am looking to expand my opportunities in my projects with anything related to fullstack development.
